# My Area of Expertise

I am going to speak truthfully and say that frankly I am rather unsure if I __*have*__ any area over which I would consider myself master. I was sickly most of my life, and rather directionless, I knew I wanted to be something, I just never knew what it was.

If anything with my being sick all the time I'd say the area in which I found myself exceling the most was with people skills. Learning to navigate peoples emotions, getting them to open up in cases, in esscense learning how to sell myself. 

The application asked that we provide a writing sample in which we "explain a complex idea from a area of our expertise" and since I do not have one all I can present is this sample in and of itself.

I have almost no coding knowledge everything I am doing right now I learned from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo&t=758s "Learn to code"), which I hope at least will show that I am dedicated and will push myself so that I may be succesful in this field.

Thank You for consideration
